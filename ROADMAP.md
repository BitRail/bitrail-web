# Bitrail Roadmap

Cross-protocol position monitoring, health scoring, and guarded capital routing for sBTC, stBTC, and Zest positions.

---

## Grant Proposal Summary

> **What are we building?** Bitrail is a natural language interface for Bitcoin DeFi on Stacks. It exposes 144+ operations across ALEX, Velar, BitFlow, Arkadiko, Granite, and PoX through a chat UI and MCP server, letting users trade, lend, and stack without writing code or reading docs. The x402 layer adds pay-per-call monetization for AI agents, creating a sustainable revenue model for MCP tool providers on Stacks.
>
> **Who is it for?** STX holders, DeFi users, and AI agent developers who want programmatic access to Bitcoin DeFi without custodial intermediaries.
>
> **Why does it matter for Stacks?** It lowers the barrier to entry for the entire Stacks DeFi ecosystem and introduces a new monetization primitive (HTTP 402 pay-per-call) that any protocol or tool provider can adopt.

## Grant Milestones

| # | Deliverable | Target Date | Verification |
|---|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Deploy x402 gateway to production with STX, sBTC, and USDCx payment support | Q3 2026 | Live gateway URL + on-chain payment transaction logs |
| 2 | Add sBTC lending support via Granite (2 new MCP tools: deposit, borrow) | Q3 2026 | Deployed tools + integration test suite + testnet demo |
| 3 | Ship desktop app (Mac + Linux) connecting to local Clarinet devnet | Q4 2026 | GitHub release + install guide + devnet walkthrough video |
| 4 | Reputation system: on-chain NFT badges for top contributors (SIP-009) | Q1 2027 | Deployed contract address + minting demo |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| ALEX/Velar/Arkadiko API changes break tools | Medium | Medium | Versioned plugin architecture; graceful error handling already in place; fallback to Stacks API directly |
| OpenAI cost scaling with user growth | Medium | High | x402 pay-per-call model offsets costs; rate limiting in middleware |
| Arkadiko mainnet-only limitation confuses users | Low | Low | Already documented in README and UI warnings; Granite covers testnet lending |
| Desktop app Electron/Tauri security surface | Low | Medium | No private key storage on disk; wallet signing stays in Leather/Xverse |
| Single-developer bottleneck on delivery | Medium | Medium | Milestones scoped conservatively; open-source contributions welcome |
